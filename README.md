_The application I made for my lovely housemates._ :heart::house_with_garden:

I made this app to learn more about JavaScript, NodeJS and ReactJS, as I was interested in this technology stack and had never used it before. **I learned A LOT** during this journey and the result can be found in this repository.

## Features
Its features are quite limited at the moment as it is early days, but more will be added (soon &trade;).

The basic idea is that this app will create a cleaning rota for your housemates, so that they can easily look up what chores they have to do this week.
But maybe this application will eventually become a complete home assistant, who knows :wink: (open for contributions).

**Current features**:
* Generate a weekly rotation of tasks that are assigned to registered users
* Log in with email/password combination
* View upcoming tasks
* Mark tasks as 'done' and optionally undo this action

## How to run
* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install && npm run dev`

## Limitations
This thing is NOT quite ready to run anywhere but your local dev machine... use at own risk.
